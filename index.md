# Welcome #
Thanks for visiting. The goal of this site is to share my information security experience with others in the community. One of the many hot topics is 2017 and will continue into 2018 is Endpoint Protection and how to test. While working for a client on this very topic, I worked in the background on a reusable testing strategy / framework that others could use for themselves and their organisations.
