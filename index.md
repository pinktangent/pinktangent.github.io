# Welcome #
Thanks for visiting. The goal of this site is to share my information security experience with others in the community. 

One of the many hot topics of 2017 and will continue into 2018 is Endpoint Protection and how to test the different solutions on the market. If my BlackHat USA talk highlighted anything to me, more organisations and the people that work in the defensive space are challenged knowing where to start. While working for a client on this initiative, I developed in the background a reusable [testing framework](https://github.com/pinktangent/Endpoint-Testing/tree/master/Testing-Framework) that others could use for themselves and their organisation.

In addition to the framework, I wanted to be able to give back the process involved, all the different testing scenarios and how-to's. I hope to accomplish this by writing the first online / self-paced Endpoint Protection POC workshop.

Good Luck and enjoy. [Email me](mailto:tangentmelb@gmail.com) with any questions.
